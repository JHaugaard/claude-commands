# Launching Bypass Permissions Mode

Starting a new Claude Code session with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag...

**Warning:** All permission prompts will be skipped. Use only for trusted, predictable tasks.

To return to normal mode later, use `/dsp-off` or simply start a new session without the flag.

!claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
