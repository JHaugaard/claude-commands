Begin a new session.

## Steps

1. Ask: "What are we working on this session?"

2. Write `.claude/session-context.md`:

```markdown
# Session Context

## Current Focus
[User's stated focus]

## Key Decisions
-

## Notes
- Session started: [timestamp]
```

3. Say: "Context is set. Let's get started. Run /session-end when done to clean up."
